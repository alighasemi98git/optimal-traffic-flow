# Optimal Traffic Flow

This project addresses the **System-Optimal Traffic Assignment (SOTA)** problem for urban networks, applied to a case study of the Stockholm inner region. Using **nonlinear programming techniques**, the goal is to minimize total travel time by modeling congestion dynamics and evaluating strategies for capacity improvements.

## Project Overview

* **Problem Type:** Traffic assignment optimization
* **Context:** Urban transportation planning
* **Case Study:** 14-node abstraction of Stockholmâ€™s central and suburban regions
* **Key Features:**

  * Free-flow (linear programming) model
  * Congestion-aware (nonlinear programming) model using Davidsonâ€™s volume-delay function
  * Convex optimization formulation ensuring global optimality
  * Analysis of bottlenecks and road capacity improvements

## Models

1. **Free-Flow Model (LP)**

   * Ignores congestion effects
   * Reduces to multiple shortest-path problems
   * Provides a baseline for ideal travel times

2. **Congestion Model (NLP)**

   * Incorporates Davidsonâ€™s delay function
   * Captures rising travel times as flows approach capacity
   * Formulated as a convex NLP ensuring global solutions

## Results

* Congestion shifts flows away from oversaturated arcs, redistributing traffic to alternative routes
* Key congested links identified: arcs (4,5), (5,0), (7,0), (8,5)
* Capacity improvements on these arcs reduce overall travel times
* Model predictions align with observed traffic patterns in Stockholm

## Potential Improvements

* Incorporating fairness objectives (e.g., minimizing maximum individual travel time)
* Including environmental factors such as **COâ‚‚ emissions** or fuel consumption
* Modeling **time-dependent demand** and **road pricing** for more realism
